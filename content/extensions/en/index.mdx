### Information Collected
#### Personal Information
My extensions do not collect any personal information of its users.

My extensions do not handle or have access to credit card numbers or payment account login information. Donations and other payments are processed instead by PayPal, and the information provided to them is handled by their website. Please consult their privacy policy here.

Donation/Payment info, including payment amount, first/last name, and date of purchase, is stored in my private records for accounting purposes.

#### Anonymous Aggregate and Analytical Information
My extensions do not gather any analytical data using Google analytics or any similar analytics gathering service.

My extensions might collect some anonymized and aggregate information (using custom solutions) used primarily for improving that extension. That information would include the urls of websites causing issues, browser version information, and analysis of the structure of websites.

#### Children’s Privacy
I really have a soft spot for children. For that reason a firm belief of mine is to keep them and their privacy safe. I do not knowingly collect or possess personally identifiable information from persons under 13 years-of-age. If I learn that this is not the case, I will delete the information and take steps in order to prevent it from happening again.

### What I do with Collected Information
#### Your Information is not for Sale
I never have or ever will sell or share personal information to any third parties. Period. No exceptions. However, occasionally some aggregate or analytical information that isn’t personally identifiable might shared to the public or 3rd parties in order to promote my work or improve my extensions.

#### Regarding the Law
I will fully comply and cooperate with United States law enforcement. That may include disclosing any and all relevant information I posess to the law.
Additionally, when I believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect the safety of others or myself, I reserve my right to disclose any relevant information in my possession to the law.

### Your Privacy Options

Do note that it is not in my power to delete information collected by PayPal, the google chrome webstore, or any other 3rd party.

### Data Security
